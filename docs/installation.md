# Installation

The converter is a python script that must be run from the command line. Executable apps are in the works.

These instructions assume you have python installed. If you don't, I suggest you use miniconda to create a simply python environment.

1. Download this repository (click on green `Code` button and download zip, or clone).
2. If you downloaded the zip, unzip it. Put the whole folder somewhere easy to find, you'll need to know the path to it later.

If you are going to use hot spot type questions, I've included a small script that will load an image and record the coordinates of a polygon you define on the image by clicking on it. Only if you want to use that, you will need to also install `opencv-python` and `matplotlib` with `pip`.
    + `pip install opencv-python matplotlib`
